# Predicting the Potency by Analysizing QASR activity of "Replicase polyprotein-1ab"


## Aim for this research
###This study aims to identify compounds for in silico drug screenings of Replicase polyprotein 1ab, the principal protein in Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the Coronavirus. Molecular docking will be performed on the compounds with the highest potency while adhering to the Lipinski Rule of 5, which includes absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.

## About the Protein
Replicase polyprotein-1a is a Multifunctional protein involved in the transcription and replication of viral RNAs. Contains the proteinases responsible for the cleavages of the polyprotein ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/P0C6X7 ).
